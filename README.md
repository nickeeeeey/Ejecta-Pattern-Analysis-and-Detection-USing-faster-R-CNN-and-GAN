This project focuses on leveraging the Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) for accurate moon crater detection. Additionally, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is employed to enhance the dataset for improved model training. The Faster R-CNN is trained to identify and classify moon craters in lunar images, while the GAN augments the dataset by generating synthetic crater variations. This combined approach enhances the model's robustness in recognizing craters under diverse conditions, contributing to more reliable lunar surface analysis.
